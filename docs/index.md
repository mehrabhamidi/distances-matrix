## Usage

* `annotateBinary(input_id, input_chr, input_start, input_end, annot_id = NULL, annot_chr, annot_start, annot_end)`: This function annotates the input genomic regions with a given "binary" annotation. A "binary" annotation is simply a set of genomic regions without any extra attribute (e.g. the set of enhancers/promoters or the set of eQTLs).

                
  __inputs__:
  * **input_id**: Character vector defining the name of input genomic regions (e.g. gene id)
  * **input_chr**: 	Character vector defining the name of the chromosome for input genomic regions (one of chr1, chr2, ..., chrX, chrY or chrM).
  * **input_start**: Numeric vector specifying the starting position of input genomic regions.
  * **input_end**: Numeric vector specifying the ending position of input genomic regions.
  * **annot_id**: Optional (NULL by default): Character vector defining the name or ID of each annotation entry. If NULL, the row numbers (indexes) are used as IDs.
  * **annot_chr**: Character vector defining the name of the chromosome for annotation entries (one of chr1, chr2, ..., chrX, chrY or chrM).
  * **annot_start**: Numeric vector specifying the starting position of annotation entries.
  * **annot_end**: Numeric vector specifying the ending position of annotation entries.
  
   __outputs__:
   * **input_ID**: Character vector defining the name of input genomic regions (e.g. gene id)
   * **input_chr**: Character vector defining the name of the chromosome for input genomic regions (one of chr1, chr2, ..., chrX, chrY or chrM).
   * **input_start**: Numeric vector specifying the starting position of input genomic regions.
   * **input_end**: Numeric vector specifying the ending position of input genomic regions.
   * **overlap_count**: Numeric vector specifying the count of overlapped annotations with that geneID.
   * **overlapping_annot_IDs**: Character vector specifying the IDs of overlapped annotations with that geneID (separated by comma).

  
* `annotateMultiScore(input_id, input_chr, input_start, input_end, annot_chr, annot_start, annot_end, annot_sub_id, annot_sub_score)`: This function annotates the input genomic regions with a given "multi-score" annotation. A "multi-score" annotation specifies a set of genomic regions and assigns a set of sub-IDs and their corresponding sub-scores to each of them (e.g. the annotation of DNAse hypersensitive clusters by ENCODE).
                
  __inputs__:

  * **input_start**: Numeric vector specifying the starting position of input genomic regions.
  * **input_end**: Numeric vector specifying the ending position of input genomic regions.
  * **annot_chr**: Character vector defining the name of the chromosome for annotation entries (one of chr1, chr2, ..., chrX, chrY or chrM).

    * **input_chr**: Character vector defining the name of the chromosome for input genomic regions (one of chr1, chr2, ..., chrX, chrY or chrM).
  * **input_start**: Numeric vector specifying the starting position of input genomic regions.

   * **overlap_sub_percentages**: The percentage of overlap between each input region and its overlapping sub-IDs (separated by comma).
   
   __Note__:
   * For each input genomic region, the average score of annotation for each sub-ID is measured as the weighted average of scores of overlapping annotation entries where the percentages of overlaps of annotation entries with the input region are taken as weights (this is measured for each sub-ID separately). The percentage of overlap between an input genomic region with a specific annotation sub-ID is calculated as the total portion of the input region that is covered by that annotation sub-ID divided by the length of the region.

  __Note__:
  * For each input genomic region, the average score of annotation is measured as the weighted average of scores of overlapping annotation entries where the percentages of overlaps of annotation entries with the input region are taken as weights. The percentage of overlap between an input genomic region with annotation entries is calculated as the total portion of the input region that is covered by the annotation entries divided by the length of the region.
